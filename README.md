# Number Guessing Game

**Description:**

This repository contains two versions of a classic guessing game implemented in C++ using the Embarcadero compiler:

1. **Original Version:** Your initial implementation of the guessing game, reflecting your unique approach.
2. **Enhanced Version:** A version based on lecture materials, featuring an upgraded UI with number guessing hints (higher or lower).

**How to Play:**

This game is designed for two players. Here's how it works:

1. **Player 1:** Chooses a secret number to be guessed (within a specified range).
2. **Player 2:** Takes turns guessing the number.
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback to Player 2:
   - If the guess is higher than the secret number, a message like "Too high!" is displayed.
   - If the guess is lower than the secret number, a message like "Too low!" is displayed.
   - (For Enhanced Version only) The game also indicates how close Player 2 is getting with a message like "Getting warmer!" or "Getting colder!" (optional).
4. Player 2 continues guessing until they correctly identify the secret number.
5. The game displays the total number of guesses it took Player 2 to find the number.

**Building the Project:**

**Prerequisites:**

- Embarcadero C++ compiler (version details can be specified here)

**Steps:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Embarcadero IDE (e.g., C++Builder).
3. Configure project settings if necessary (e.g., build options, output directory).
4. Build the project.

**Running the Game:**

1. Double-click the executable file generated by the build process.
2. The program will prompt Player 1 to enter the secret number.
3. The game will then guide Player 2 through the guessing rounds.

**Versions:**

- `original` (Your original code)
- `enhanced` (Lecture-based version with improved UI)
